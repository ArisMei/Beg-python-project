# Project Beginner PAY for Engineers

## Summary
Our team will focus on studying the relationship (if any) of the average land temperature (i.e., #2 proposed dataset) and the evolution of population in such land, along with its GDP. Datasets will be pulled from the World Bank and are available in `.csv`, `.xml` and `.xlsx` formats in the following links, respectively:

[Population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

[GDP (2015 USD)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD)

Behavior will be analysed mainly by visual means (such as scatterplots, pyramid populations, etc.) and reported in Markdown in the corresponding .ipynb file.
